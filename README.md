# Design Patterns C#

The aim of this project was to develop a CRUD application using MVC in order to practice my C# (.Net technology) skills as well as have a little bit of fun coding :)


P.S. this is an exercise from The C# PeopleCert Bootcamp, a 6-month course (500 hrs) that aims to provide a complete path for students to go from zero to employed as web developers while working with other students along the way. Check this out: (https://peoplecerteducation.org/bootcamp/)
